# Primary Key vs Foreign Key in SQL

**Primary Key:**
- Uniquely identifies each record in a table
- Cannot contain NULL values
- Must be unique for each record
- Only one primary key per table (though it can consist of multiple columns)
- Creates a clustered index by default (in many database systems)
- Example: `customer_id` in a Customers table
