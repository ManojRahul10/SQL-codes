# Primary Key vs Foreign Key in SQL

**Primary Key:**
- Uniquely identifies each record in a table
- Cannot contain NULL values
- Must be unique for each record
- Only one primary key per table (though it can consist of multiple columns)
- Creates a clustered index by default (in many database systems)
- Example: `customer_id` in a Customers table


**Foreign Key:**
- References a primary key in another table
- Creates a relationship between two tables
- Can contain NULL values (unless constrained otherwise)
- Can have multiple foreign keys in a table
- Used to maintain referential integrity
- Example: `customer_id` in an Orders table referencing the Customers table
