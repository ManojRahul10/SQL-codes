Functions : it is a predefined operations that perform specific table like calculation, manipulation.
1) Scalar Function
2) Aggregate function


Definition of Scalar Functions
A Scalar Function in SQL operates on a single value and returns a single value as output. It is used to perform operations like string manipulation, mathematical calculations, and date formatting.

Examples of Scalar Functions:
String Functions: UPPER(), LOWER(), CONCAT()
Math Functions: ROUND(), ABS(), FLOOR()
Date Functions: NOW(), YEAR(), DATEDIFF()
System Functions: USER(), DATABASE()

Definition of Aggregate Functions
Aggregate functions in SQL perform calculations on multiple rows and return a single value as output. They are commonly used with the GROUP BY clause to summarize data.

Common Aggregate Functions:
SUM() – Returns the total sum of a column.
AVG() – Returns the average value.
COUNT() – Returns the number of rows.
MAX() – Returns the maximum value.
MIN() – Returns the minimum value.

CREATE TABLE mytable(
names varchar(50),
cities varchar(50),
states varchar(50),
code int primary key);

Insert into mytable (names, cities, states,code)
values
('Manoj Rahul','Trichy','Tamilnadu',620010),
('Aravind','Trichy','Tamilnadu',620012),
('Ajay','Trichy','Tamilnadu',620013);

--Scalar Function--


select UPPER(names) as uppercase_name from mytable;

select lower(names) as uppercase_name from mytable;

select names, len(names) as length_name from mytable;	

select names, cities, concat( names, ' from ' , cities) as concat_val from mytable;


--aggregate function--

SELECT SUM(code) AS total_salary FROM mytable;

Select count(code) as count_Code from mytable;

select  max(code) as max_code from mytable;

select  min(code) as max_code from mytable;

select AVG(code) as avg_code from mytable;
